# Cheapest Pints on the RTA Rapid

Last November while visiting London, a local org released a map of all the cheapest beer pints easily accessible using the subway (the "tube," as it's called across the pond). See it here: https://storekit.com/advice/storekit-london-tube-map-cheapest-pints-closest-pub-2022

Of course I thought Cleveland needs one of these as well, or at least someone should start trying to make one. I wanted it to be attractive like London's, so that first required me to essentially recreate our rapid system map. (All of the maps online aren't really easily-editable for this project, and this felt like a good project to gain some SVG format knowledge.)

I don't drink that much beer though, and didn't make much progress outside of the near west side and what I could easily find on online menus back last December. There's many blanks and ???s, so please help out if that's your cup of tea!
